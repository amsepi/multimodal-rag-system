# RAG System Improvements for Better Accuracy

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to address accuracy issues in the multimodal RAG system.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The original system had several issues leading to incomplete answers:
- **Large chunk size (512)** causing imprecise retrieval
- **Basic retrieval** without query expansion or re-ranking
- **Weak prompting** not encouraging comprehensive answers
- **No context optimization** leading to token limit issues
- **Poor metadata extraction** missing important information

## üîß Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Chunking Strategy

**Before:**
```python
chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=50
```

**After:**
```python
chunk_size=256, chunk_overlap=100
```

**Improvements:**
- **Smaller chunks** for more precise retrieval
- **Increased overlap** to prevent information loss
- **Better separators** including sentence boundaries
- **Enhanced metadata** extraction (numbers, dates, keywords, sections)
- **Text cleaning** to remove PDF artifacts
- **Minimum chunk filtering** to remove noise

### 2. Advanced Retrieval System

**New Features:**
- **Query Expansion**: Automatically expands queries with synonyms
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines multiple query variations
- **Metadata Filtering**: Boosts scores based on content relevance
- **Re-ranking**: Uses content overlap and length scoring
- **Fallback Strategy**: Broadens search if initial results are poor

**Example Query Expansion:**
```
"budget" ‚Üí ["funding", "allocation", "finance", "cost"]
"revenue" ‚Üí ["income", "earnings", "sales", "profit"]
```

### 3. Improved LLM Generation

**Enhanced Prompting:**
- **Multiple strategies**: comprehensive, detailed, step-by-step, academic
- **Context optimization**: Fits within token limits while preserving important info
- **Post-processing**: Checks answer quality and retries if needed
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Multiple strategies if one fails

**Better Prompts:**
- Explicit instructions for comprehensive answers
- Requirements to include specific numbers and dates
- Instructions to acknowledge missing information
- Clear formatting and structure requirements

### 4. Configuration Management

**Centralized Settings:**
- All parameters configurable via environment variables
- Easy tuning without code changes
- Quality thresholds and scoring weights
- Model and strategy selection

## üìä Performance Improvements

### Retrieval Accuracy
- **More precise chunks** (256 vs 512 characters)
- **Query expansion** catches related terms
- **Metadata boosting** improves relevance scoring
- **Re-ranking** ensures best results first

### Answer Completeness
- **Multiple retrieval strategies** with fallbacks
- **Context optimization** fits more relevant information
- **Enhanced prompting** encourages comprehensive answers
- **Post-processing** ensures quality standards

### System Robustness
- **Error handling** at each step
- **Fallback mechanisms** for poor results
- **Quality thresholds** to filter low-confidence results
- **Multiple strategies** for different query types

## üöÄ Usage

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Chunking
export CHUNK_SIZE=256
export CHUNK_OVERLAP=100
export MIN_CHUNK_LENGTH=50

# Retrieval
export DEFAULT_TOP_K=12
export USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
export ENABLE_QUERY_EXPANSION=true
export MIN_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.5

# LLM
export DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4
export TEMPERATURE=0.1
export MAX_TOKENS=2000
export CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS=6000
```

### Testing Improvements
```bash
python test_improvements.py
```

## üìà Expected Results

### Before Improvements
- **Incomplete answers** due to imprecise retrieval
- **Missing details** from large, unfocused chunks
- **Poor context** leading to token limit issues
- **Basic prompting** not encouraging comprehensive responses

### After Improvements
- **More precise retrieval** with smaller, focused chunks
- **Comprehensive answers** with enhanced prompting
- **Better context handling** with optimization
- **Robust fallbacks** for edge cases
- **Configurable quality** thresholds

## üîç Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Retrieval precision**: Are the right chunks being found?
- **Answer completeness**: Are all aspects of questions addressed?
- **Response quality**: Are answers detailed and accurate?
- **System performance**: Are fallbacks working effectively?

### Debugging
- Check chunk sizes and overlap settings
- Monitor retrieval scores and thresholds
- Review prompt strategies and their effectiveness
- Analyze context optimization results

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test with real documents** to validate improvements
2. **Fine-tune parameters** based on specific use cases
3. **Monitor performance** and adjust thresholds
4. **Add more sophisticated** query expansion if needed
5. **Implement A/B testing** for different strategies

## üìù Configuration Reference

### Chunking Settings
```python
CHUNK_SIZE = 256          # Smaller for precision
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 100       # More overlap
MIN_CHUNK_LENGTH = 50     # Filter noise
```

### Retrieval Settings
```python
DEFAULT_TOP_K = 12        # More results
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH = True  # Enable advanced search
ENABLE_QUERY_EXPANSION = True  # Expand queries
MIN_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.5 # Quality filter
```

### LLM Settings
```python
DEFAULT_MODEL = "gpt-4"   # Best model
TEMPERATURE = 0.1         # Consistent answers
MAX_TOKENS = 2000         # Comprehensive responses
CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS = 6000 # More context
```

This comprehensive improvement should significantly enhance the accuracy and completeness of your RAG system's answers.
